# OpenSCAD
Inprocess : Installable version of FreeCAD OpenSCAD workbench.

#branch : IndicatMinkowski

A trial version of importer that if minkowski request is for two objects, colour codes then
rather than use OpenSCAD binary to produce mesh of minkowski.

The idea being that a FreeCAD user can then make changes to the indicated objects i.e. Add fillets before deleting other object etc.
